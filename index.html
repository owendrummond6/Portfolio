                    <h3><em>Gap Year Student</em></h3>
                    <p>I'm a highly motivated and passionate student with a strong interest in pursuing software engineering and data science apprenticeships for 2025.</p>
                    <p>My fascination with mathematics has always been a big part of who I am, and I've explored advanced topics like Linear Algebra and Machine Learning, which sparked my interest in AI and programming. I'm now focused on pursuing an apprenticeship to apply my skills and enthusiasm in a practical setting.</p>
                    <p>Outside of academics, I enjoy learning about aerospace engineering, astronomy and finance through books like The Intelligent Investor and following the Air & Space Power Association.</p>
                    <p>Right now, I'm taking a gap year to proactively focus on developing the skills and mindset I'll need for an apprenticeship. I'm dedicating my time to improving my programming skills and exploring work experience opportunities that will prepare me for the next step in my career journey.</p>
