## Relevant Tech Experience

#### Internship at NapierAI
- Role: Data Science / Machine Learning Intern
- Duration: September 2024 - Present
- Responsibilities: 
  - During my internship, I played a pivotal role in developing and deploying a Machine Learning model for anti-money laundering. This model analyses over 10 key financial metrics across 30+ countries, having a direct global impact on financial approaches.

    I conducted thorough analyses of the model's results and generated comprehensive visualisations and graphs in Excel for a designer. These visualisations were incorporated into high-profile reports for publications such as the Financial Times and Bloomberg, enabling informed decision-making within the financial sector.

    Additionally, I successfully led a team of six members, providing guidance on complex data-related queries and ensuring accurate inference on raw data. My leadership contributed to influencing decision-making for businesses across multiple international markets.
